The operation of SPIO is dynamically generated by the user's custom config
> To ensure the orderliness of import and user operability, only one format (suffix name) file is allowed to exist in a single import

When the user has no config preferences
+ Pop up the import option menu for the blend file
+ Directly import the recognition format (the default importer in blender, such as stl, obj, etc.)
+ For non-recognized formats, the picture import menu will pop up

When the user has the config in the corresponding format
+ If the config has no matching rules, use this preference to import
+ If the config has file name matching rules and matches, use this preference to import
+ If the config has file name matching rules and does not match, the non-compliant file will be saved to the temporary file list. 
  After all the matching items are imported, the selection menu (such as the image importer) will pop up to import
