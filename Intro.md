> PIO is an auxiliary blender plug-in, used to improve the efficiency of users importing blend file model pictures from outside
>
> Currently supports windows platform

### Quick Start

The use of SPIO is very simple.<br>After installing the plug-in from the preferences and enabling it, you only need to copy the file from the windows explorer `Ctrl+C`, and in the 3d view `Ctrl+Shift+V` can import the file. 

SPIO allows **single/batch** to import all the formats included in the default import menu, and can also support additional import of the detailed categories of blend files. 

For non-model files (or unrecognized formats) SPIO treats them as images

In the **3D view**, you can choose to import it as a reference or image plane

In the **shading editor** and **geometry node editor**, import it as an image texture node



### 自定义

SPIO allows highly customized import config to meet complex import requirements
